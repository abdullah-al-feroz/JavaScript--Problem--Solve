131. Write a JavaScript program to create an array of prefix sums of the given array. Go to the editor
In computer science, the prefix sum, cumulative sum, inclusive scan, or simply scan of a sequence of numbers x0, x1, x2, ... is a second sequence of numbers y0, y1, y2, ..., the sums of prefixes of the input sequence:
y0 = x0
y1 = x0 + x1
y2 = x0 + x1+ x2


132. Write a JavaScript program to find all distinct prime factors of a given integer. 

133. Write a JavaScript program to check whether a given fraction is proper or not.
Note: There are two types of common fractions, proper or improper. When the numerator and the denominator are both positive, the fraction is called proper if the numerator is less than the denominator, and improper otherwise.

134. Write a JavaScript program to change the characters (lower case) in a string where a turns into z, b turns into y, c turns into x, ..., n turns into m, m turns into n, ..., z turns into a.

135. Write a JavaScript program to remove all characters from a given string that appear more than once.

136. Write a JavaScript program to replace the first digit in a string (should contains at least digit) with $ character.

137. Write a JavaScript program to test whether a given integer is greater than 15 return the given number, otherwise return 15. 

138. Write a JavaScript program to reverse the bits of a given 16 bits unsigned short integer.

139. Write a JavaScript program to find the position of a rightmost round number in an array of integers. Returns 0 if there are no round number.  
Note: A round number is informally considered to be an integer that ends with one or more zeros.

140. Write a JavaScript program to check whether all the digits in a given number are the same or not.
